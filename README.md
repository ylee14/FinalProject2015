Final Project for Web Projects, 2015.

## Final Project Proposal

My final project for this class will ultimately be about building my own portfolio website. 
I've looked at many inspiring personal websites and was able to come down into three different concepts I wanted to include in my work: simple, interactive, and catalog. Although Robby Leonardi portfolio website's bright cartoony look was something I enjoyed looking at, I think my photographs would fit better on a more simple website. However, I've seen too many websites with traditional style, which is white background with black letters, so I want to incorporate user-interactive concept to make the website more interesting. Also, as portfolio website is a place to show my work and my ability as an artist, I want to use the website as the curator of my work.
